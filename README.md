# Road-Accident-Analysis
The project focuses on a comparison study on road accident analysis for 3 locations Australia, the UK, and the USA. The data is fetched using APIs from government portals. The unstructured JSON data is converted into structured data frames and is further pre-processed and cleaned using Pandas and NumPy. All the clean data frames are written in PostgreSQL and is fetched back in the Python environment. A comparison visual study based on accident frequency based on days, road defects, year-wise and gender-based trends are identified for thorough analysis.

1.	Programming Language: Python
2.	Tools and Methodologies Used: Data Pre-processing and Cleaning, Data Transformation, Spyder, MongoDB Compass, PostgreSQL, Docker Virtual Machine, API Data fetch, Data visualisation.

# Road Accident Analysis
The rising number of road accidents in any location is impacted by a number of factors such as road quality, weather conditions, technical failures of vehicles, driver errors and accident hotspots. This study focuses on analysing the road accidents at three locations Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom. The data for all three geographies include a few common parameters such as weather conditions, latitude, longitude, age, gender, and the number of fatalities. The casualties and fatalities due to road accidents is a major issue across the globe. Similarly, the three selected locations have high accident numbers which need to be addressed and analysed to identify key reasons for its occurrence. The analysis is implemented based on the lighting conditions and road types to verify if these parameters are critical in causing a road accident or not. Moreover, gender and age analysis of the casualties is evaluated to recognize the categorical majority among all the accidents.  A heat map visual is created to pick out accident-prone areas. The identified areas are further analysed based on their road quality to find out the root cause of accidents. A comparison of these analyses is implemented across all three locations to recognize common issues for further exploration. A set of automated solutions are suggested in order to reduce accident fatality and in some cases its occurrence.
